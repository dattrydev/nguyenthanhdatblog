Hi there! I'm currently working as a Fullstack Java Developer at Hitachi Digital Services Vietnam and Fullstack Developer at Designveloper.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems from the University of Information Technology, VNUHCM, graduating with a Very Good classification.

My portfolio is still a work in progress, but I’m keeping it online to share my journey, showcase what I’ve learned, and hopefully spark some inspiration along the way.

Feel free to contact me via email at dattrydev@gmail.com.
