Hi there! I’m a 4th-year student at the University of Information Technology, VNUHCM, majoring in Information Systems.

I’m on track to graduate a semester early, and I’m passionate about becoming a full-stack developer in the future. Although my portfolio might be a bit outdated at the moment, I’m keeping it up as a work-in-progress to share my journey and hope it sparks some inspiration!
